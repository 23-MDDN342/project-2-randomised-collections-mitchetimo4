## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections
**This is where you talk about your project!**

FINAL README

In my project I added 4 extra files to hold the parameterised elements. These include:

heads.js      headVersion, 3 options, discrete variable
eyes.js      eyesVersion, 3 options, discrete variable
mouths.js      mouthVersion, 4 options, discrete variable
hairstyles.js      hairstyleVersion, 6 options, discrete variable

Each of these parameters have different percantages for each option, making some more rare than others. 

This program uses HTML and p5 javascript to create an interactive display of randomised faces, drawn specifically in the style of Instagram artist @desudidit (me). It combines iconic hip-hop hairstyles with a range of different facial expressions to create a display of unique characters. I decided to arrange these faces in trios, with the middle character being the main focus. This draws more attention to the faces themselves rather than a mosaic.
