## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections
**This is where you talk about your project!**

Today I uploaded my sketch image that I created on tuesday and started the creation of one of my faces in p5. I think the final results are going to be more blocky than I would have liked to begin with but I can work with it.  

2/5/23

This crit contains my progress towards drawing my faces. They are not yet in variables but the faces themselves are coming along nicely. My next step is to continue this work and get all of the features done so that I can add the randomising feature to them for hand-in. I aim to have a good selection of hairstyles, mouths, eyes and skin tones. After that I will work on the arrangement. 


5/5/23

I have now almost drawn all of the shapes nessersary to create a selection of different random faces. At the moment they are pretty similar so I am brainstorming ways for each of them to have a point of difference. I am currently thinking about creating an even bigger range of haircuts with lots of different colours. This means when they are in the arrangement its a big variation of faces with different brightly coloured haircuts. There are a few iconic celebrity hairstyles that I would like to add if I go down this route. At the moment it is seeming like the best option to make the faces stand out from each other. Creating this library of hairstyles will be my next step, as well as addinga couple more eyes and maybe a mouth. 


7/5/23

Today I added 2 more hairstyles, making the total 6. I also added the last type of eyes and another skin tone. This is enough for me to start coding what ive drawn into the sliders. Once this is done and some of the arrangement is coded I will be able to see what they all look like together. This will allow me to see what is missing and I will add new Hairstyles and colours accordingly. My next step is to link my faces and their features to sliders and begin the steps to creating an arrangement. 


9/5/23

Today I created seperate files for each component of my faces. They are now fully parameterised but arent linked to the face code file yet. My next step is to link these files and get the sliders working before I start working on the arrangement. Unfortunately I had to remove my afro hair style as it was drawn both under and over the head part, making it inpossible to put in the slider as they are drawn in different orders. I am thinking of replacing it with another hairstyle once I get the sliders working smoothly.


11/5/23

Over yesterday and today I have managed to get all of the sliders working as well as the begginings of my arrangement. Each slider now can flawlessly change either the skin tone, eye type, mouth type, and hairstyle. While doing this I added another hairstyle to make up for the removal of the afro character. My next step after having parameterised faces was to work on the arrangment code. I now have random faces drawn in a grid pattern, these change every 3 seconds and can also be cycled by clicking. For my submission I want to have an arrangement of 3 faces, possibly at different sizes. This is what I will be working on next. 


12/5/23

I have now created my final Arrangment. I decided to go for a three face design with emphasis on the middle (larger) face. This is because I wanted to show off the detail in the faces. I felt like when they were being displayed in grid form some of the detail was getting over looked by the people I was showing. I worked hard on the placement of the facial features and I feel like I executed it well so I want people to notice. A lot of my hairstyles were inspired by celebs and I think when the random faces are shown in groups of three, people are more likely to recognise the hair. My next step is to write my final readme and clean up my code.
